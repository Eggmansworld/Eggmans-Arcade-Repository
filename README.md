# Eggman’s Arcade Repository 

## Overview
Eggman’s Arcade Repository is a **community-driven preservation project** that collects arcade game dumps from across the decades. The goal is to provide a central archive where these files can survive long-term, even as forums, websites, and chatrooms disappear.  

It has two overarching goals:
1. If no emulator exists, preserve the game in a usable format such as a drive image, file copy, downloadable content, or even restore discs.
2. If an emulator exists, preserve the game and also set the game up so it can be played (non-destructive).

⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
No guarantees are made regarding playability, accuracy, or completeness.  
Use at your own discretion.

## Features
- A wide variety of arcade game dumps, old and new.
- Many game are raw dumps, restore discs or simple hard drive file copies, without emulator support.
- Some games are in mixed states:
  - Some with pre-existing loaders, or 
  - Some in a completely playable state.

- Proprietary hard drive formats (e.g., `.mrimg`) converted where possible into generic `.img` files. (Some conversions may still be pending, such as Norton Ghost '.GHO' images which require the image to be rewritten to a drive and recaptured)
- Content inherited from older abandoned collections (e.g., Yori’s).
- Heavy representation of **rhythm/Bemani games**, though completeness is not guaranteed.

---

## Goals
- Preserve arcade data in a somewhat sorted and curated condition.  
- Reduce the risk of rare dumps disappearing as communities shut down or contributors disappear.  
- Provide a base for others to build on (e.g., loaders, fixes, and emulation work).

## Exclusions
This collection **tries really hard not to** include:
- **Redump** dumps  
- **No-Intro** dumps  
- **Sega ALL.Net** dumps  
- **TeknoParrot** dumps  
- **MAME** dumps  

These projects already have their own maintainers and DATs, and should be collected separately. There may be derivative works of those aforementioned that end up in this collection.

---

## Current Status
- **Testing:** None of the dumps here are guaranteed tested or working.  
- **Duplicates:** A first pass has removed obvious duplicates, but some remain.  
- **Ongoing Work:** This repository is *always* a work in progress. Files may change, be replaced, removed for reorganized over time.

## How to Contribute
Contributions are always welcome! Ways you can help:
- **Cleanup & Curation** - Identify broken/useless files and suggest removals.  
- **Rhythm/Bemani Expertise** - These are notoriously painful to manage. If you’re knowledgeable, please share your insight.  
- **New Dumps** - Share material to grow the collection for future preservation.  
- **Playability** - Share loaders, tools, or guides that make certain games playable.  

👉 If you have something to add, feel free to open an issue, submit a pull request, or reach out directly.

## A Note to the Community
This repository will **never be finished**.  
There is still a massive amount of arcade material out there that isn’t included.  
If you have access to it - **don’t sit on it. Share it. Preserve it.**
