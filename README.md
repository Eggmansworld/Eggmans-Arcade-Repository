# Eggman‚Äôs Arcade Repository 

## Overview
Eggman‚Äôs Arcade Repository is a **community-driven preservation project** that collects arcade game dumps from across the decades.  
The goal is to provide a central archive where these files can survive long-term, even as forums, websites, and chatrooms disappear.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:**  
This repository is for archival and preservation purposes only.  
No guarantees are made regarding playability, accuracy, or completeness.  
Use at your own discretion.

## Features
- A wide variety of arcade game dumps, old and new.
- Games in mixed states:
  - Some with pre-existing loaders.
  - Some in a playable state.
  - Many as raw dumps or file copies without emulator support.
- Proprietary hard drive formats (e.g., `.mrimg`) converted where possible into generic `.img` files. (Some conversions may still be pending.)
- Content inherited from older abandoned collections (e.g., Yori‚Äôs).
- Heavy representation of **rhythm/Bemani games**, though completeness is not guaranteed.

## Exclusions
This collection **tries hard not to** include:
- **Redump** dumps  
- **No-Intro** dumps  
- **Sega ALL.Net** dumps  
- **TeknoParrot** dumps  
- **MAME** dumps  

These projects already have their own maintainers and DATs, and should be collected separately.

---

## Current Status
- **Testing:** None of the dumps here are guaranteed tested or working.  
- **Duplicates:** A first pass has removed obvious duplicates, but some remain.  
- **Ongoing Work:** This repository is *always* a work in progress. Files may change, be replaced, or reorganized over time.  

---

## Goals
- Preserve arcade data in a somewhat sorted and curated condition.  
- Reduce the risk of rare dumps disappearing as communities shut down or contributors disappear.  
- Provide a base for others to build on (e.g., loaders, fixes, and emulation work).
